# RFID Door Lock Access Control System using Arduino

The integration of RFID technology with the Arduino platform offers a significant advancement in access control systems. This project moves beyond traditional lock-and-key mechanisms by providing a more secure, efficient, and scalable solution. The system utilizes RFID tags, which act as digital keys, to grant access only to authorized users. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for future expansion and the integration of new technologies. 

## Objectives

The primary goals of this project are: 

**User Identification and Authentication:** To create a reliable system for identifying and authenticating users via RFID tags. 
**Multi-Door Access Control:** To develop a comprehensive solution for managing access across multiple doors.
**Audit Log Generation:** To implement a detailed logging mechanism for all access events to ensure accountability.
**Scalability and Extensibility:** To design an adaptable system that can easily accommodate future growth.
